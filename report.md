# Introduction: 
Describe your project scenario. Starting out, what did you hope to accomplish/learn?
# The Data:
Describe your data set and its significance. Where did you obtain this data set from? Why did you choose the data set that you did? Indicate if you carried out any preprocessing/data cleaning/outlier removal, and so on to sanitize your data.
# Experimental Design: 
Describe briefly your process, starting from where you obtained your data all the way to means of obtaining results/output. 
# Beyond the original specifications: 
Highlight clearly what things you did that went beyond the original specifications. That is, discuss what you implemented that would count toward the extra-credit portion of this project (see section below).
# Results: 
Display and discuss the results. Describe what you have learned and mention the relevance/significance of the results you have obtained.
# Testing: 
Describe what testing you did. Describe the unit tests that you wrote. Show a sample run of 1 or 2 of your tests (screen captures or copy-and-paste is fine).
# Conclusions: 
Summarize your findings, explain how these results could be used by others (if applicable), and describe ways you could improve your program. You could describe ways you might like to expand the functionality of your program if given more time.
